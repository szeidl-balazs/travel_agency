            get easily. The kind of place			
            
            that isn’t a tourist trap and
            
            where you can enjoy the
            
            major sites without being
            
            trampled by others.

        <h1>Arrival in paradise</h1>
        <p class="bread-text">Siargao is a completely different world to South East Asia’s usual hotspots. The environment, the pace of life, and the people create a truly idyllic setting. You’ll find the locals are smiling and kind, and they speak good English. Unlike many other tourist destinations, there are no  “tourist prices” here. The locals are very environmentally conscious as they know the natural environment is their most important treasure. Plastic waste and plastic bottles are not common here, straws were banned way before Europe has even started the discussions about the idea. 
  
          Within moments of arriving, you’ll get in the flow of this way of life, where everyone gets around by habal-habal (a type of motorbike with a roof that’s kind of like a tuk-tuk) on the roads and by traditional boat between the islands. You’ll even take a boat when zipping between the best beaches and surf spots. 
          
          One of the highlights of the trip is heading to the local market to buy all kinds of fresh fish, seafood, fruit and veg. We’ll then take our haul over to a  breathtakingly beautiful island where a local family will cook a delicious traditional meal for us that we’ll enjoy on a white sandy beach.
